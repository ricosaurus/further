# further

Further is a python framework that handles the evolution of computationally intensive analytical research projects with complex interdependencies.  Further strives to bridge the gap between exploratory research and mature, well formed code by ensuring reproducibilty, memoizing computationally expensive analysis, and handling parameter states within or between projects.  It provides a structured development path from quick analyses to reusable and reliable code.

Further is in the mid stages of development.  Expect useable code by early 2026.
